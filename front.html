    <p class="text-white fw-bold">Multiple lines of text that form the lede, informing new readers quickly and efficiently about what’s most interesting in this post’s contents.Have you ever wondered how a website works? The buttons you can click and the motions on a website are examples of front-end development. The visual appeal of every existing website or application you’ve seen has been brought to life by Front-End developers. The front-end layer enables you to interact with the web and perform desired actions, such as watching videos and shopping online, etc. To create the design, feel, and look of the web, three fundamental front-end programming languages are used: HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript.

        Top frontend technologies
    </h3>

    <article class="blog-post">
      <h2 class="blog-post-title">1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h2>
      

      <p>Let’s start with the fundamentals. HTML is the core of frontend development and this situation is not going to change anytime soon. Thanks to this technology, you are able to create the “skeleton” or — using other words — the “markup” for your website. HTML elements provide you with options to add buttons, forms, containers, and much more.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2 class="blog-post-title">2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>

      <p>Another “core” frontend technology. CSS helps you to create some additional styling rules to the previously created HTML structure. Besides that, proper CSS rules make your web application responsive (so it looks good on every screen size and device) and more interactive with some eye-catching animations.</p>
      
      <h2 class="blog-post-title">3. JavaScript</h2>
      <p>  JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that was, is, and will be, one of the most important frontend technologies. It allows you to dynamically modify the contents of your app or website.

        That means that whatever feature you are considering on the frontend side of the application — you can implement that in JavaScript. That includes, e.g., a shopping cart on your web store, complex animations, an app that counts your taxes, web browser games, and anything else that you usually see on the web — it’s most likely done with help of JavaScript technology.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">5. Angular</h2>
        <p>Angular is a full-fledged JavaScript-based frontend framework supported by Google. The modularity and component-based approach it provides has gathered a strong community among frontend developers across the whole world.

            Some developers say that it’s a bit harder to learn Angular than React but it’s definitely worth it as there is a high demand on the market for experts in this technology:</p>

        <h3>What does a full-stack developer do?</h3>
        
<p> 
    Full-stack developers design and create websites and applications for various platforms. A full-stack developer’s job description might include the following:
    
    Develop and maintain web services and interfaces
    
    Contribute to front-end and back-end development processes
    
    Build new product features or APIs
    
    Perform tests, troubleshoot software, and fix bugs
    
    Collaborate with other departments on projects and sprints
    
    The world of full-stack development is large, and many new and evolving technologies continually push the limits of what a full-stack developer can create. Staying on top of cutting-edge technology and techniques in the full-stack development field is one of the many exciting aspects of working in this role.
    
    According to LinkedIn's 2020 Emerging Jobs Report, the industries with the most full-stack developer jobs are:
    
    Computer software
    
    Information technology and services
    
    Internet
    
    Financial services
    
    Higher education
    
    Full-stack developer skills
    Full-stack developers may be creative, graphically inclined, internet- and tech-savvy, and have excellent attention to detail. You’ll want to learn the following skills to have a career in full-stack development:
    
    Front-end development is the process of creating the interface of a website. It entails coding details like drop-down menus, fonts, colors, and page layouts. Full-stack developers should also know how to work with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and scripting languages such as JavaScript to make websites and applications visually viable and appealing. If you want to transition into full-stack development from back-end development, you might consider earning a </p>
